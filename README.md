# Analysing-the-effect-of-Climatic-Conditions-on-the-Spread-of-COVID-19-in-R
# Motivation:
- COVID-19 is a pandemic that originated from Wuhan City in China and now has spread across the world. It has crippled the world economy and has swept across the world at such a pace that it has infected about 4.2 million people and about 280,000 people have died because of it.
- Since, the first case recorded in China, different countries have and are still batteling with it by enforcing strict measures and doing whatever they can. Some countries like United States, Japan and United Kingdom which have one of the best healthcare systems in the world and are leaders in economy are dealing with it in certain ways, while other countries like Pakistan or Mexico, which are not established economicaly and don't have adequate healthcare systems are dealing with it in their own ways.
- However, my idea was to see if despite all these Economic Conditions, Healthcare system and strategic planning etc., do "climatic Conditions" have any effect (Contributing Factor) on the Spread of COVID-19 cases. E.g does High temperature or low humidity slow down the spread od COVID-19 or help it.
- But analyzing this effect is not that easy because different countries have different conditions and their own ways of handling the COVID-19 situation, as mentioned above. So, pointing out the effect of Climatic Conditions on the Spread of COVID-19 woud take some strategic  thinking and analytical rigor.
- Thus, i have attempted to use my Analytical and Statistical skills to design a strategy for analysing this effect and for implementation i have used R programming Language.
# Dataset:
Data was gathered for climatic conditions of 15 countries, which included Max, Min and Avg values per day for Temperature, Humidity and Wind. 
- The COVID-19 cases data was gathered from Wikipedia for respective countries.
- The Climate data was gathered from this website: https://en.climate-data.org
# Limitations:
- All this analysis is based on data that has been gathered from only 15 cities in a specific country. It has also been collected for the month of March. So there can be multiple omitted vairables that have not been taken into consideration.
- To any reader, this is a very humble attempt to use my Analytical and Statistical skills to try and answer some of the questions that i found intriguing during this COVID-19 Pandemic. There could be tons of other latent factors like Social Status, Age, Strategic Decision Making, Healthcare Conditions, Economic Status etc. that could also effect the spread of COVID-19 cases. My attempt is just to showcase that if climatic conditions were a contributing cause towards the Spread of COVID Cases.
